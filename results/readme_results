This subfolder contains four Matlab scripts and a subfolder named "data" which contains the datasets used by the scripts to obtain the tables and figures presented in the paper.
The names of the scripst have been designed to be self explanatory. 
For example, "table1_script" is the script that must be run in Matlab in order to obtain the data presented in the Table 1 of the paper.
It must be noted that to obtain exactly the same result as the present in the figure 1 of the paper, the correspondent script (figure1_script) must be run in Matlab release 2020b or forward.
