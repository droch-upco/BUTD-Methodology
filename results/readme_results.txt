This subfolder contains:
- The four Matlab scripts used to generate the tables and figures presented in the paper. The name of each script is self-explanatory (e.g. "table1_script" is the script that must be run in Matlab to obtain the data presented in the Table 1 of the paper).
- A subfolder named "data" which contains the datasets used by the scripts.

Some observations that must be taken into account:
- "table1_script" generates the tables "summary_yy_means" which contain the information depicted in table 1 for years 2015,2016,2017.
- "table2_script" generates the table "table2_results" with the weight and the pvalue given for each high frequency indicator selected. It also generates the variables "R2" and "intercept" that provides, respectively, the R-squared and the intercept of the regression.
- To obtain figure 1 in the same format of the paper, the correspondent script (figure1_script) must be run in Matlab release 2020b or forward.
